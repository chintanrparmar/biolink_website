## Create your own version!
### It will take a minute to create your own version with all your profile information that too, from a single file change.
-   Open [Constants](https://github.com/chintanrparmar/biolink_website/blob/main/lib/utils/constants.dart), Edit the profile related fields, Thats It!
-   For hosting, you can use any cloud service provider, I prefer firebase cloud hosting for flutter web apps. You can visit [Deploying to the Web](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/web) for more hosting related information.
